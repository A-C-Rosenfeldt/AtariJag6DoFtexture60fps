Registers R28 and R29 may not be used by the under-lying code as they are corrupted, in addition to 
R30 and R31 which are always for interrupts only

So to use all registers, I need to clear bit 4-8 in the flag register

; move framebuffer around for software on DSP? Move code around? All for a little less splitting?
; At least make cache compatible! It alreay occupies the same memory ( 4x4 blocks x 4 lines x 4 acossiations)
