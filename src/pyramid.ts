// I want efficient 3d clipping. Instructions take time. I want to showcase portals. Not as band aids as in Tomb Raider, but as foam as in Duke3d.
// Already with NDC and even pixel clipping, the 3 cut order needs to be rechecked. So there is 2d checking. Just I don't want to apply it and then discard the vertex most of the time.
// This applies to both the walls in the room behind the portal and the ships.
/* I need to avoid overflow. All vertices need to be clearly inside .. yeah well if I use NDC, they have 1px guard band to not overflow
with portals we have to squeeze in two tolerance: NDC -> portal -> edge .
The 3d portal needs to be a little wider than the 2d portal. This feels expensive to be -- or at least disturbing to the concept.
Edge test also happens in 3d. Also needs wider portals. Okay, widening is rotation of the beam normals. Expensive: take xy, wedge, normalize. No: 
r= sqrt(x^2+y^2) 
z+= r
x += x/r * z
y += y/r * z

So this rotation only eats half of the overflow .. Ah I can increase the guard band.
So now, all vertices are on screen and even the horion edges have different signs on the corners.
As I discuss with the BSP, the cut points will be rounded. Vertices will be sorted into the BSP perfectly. Edges may not:
First edge is clipped on root.
then edge is clipped on child. The cut vertex cooridnate makes it look like it is fully in one grand child, but in reality it is not.
After the BSP tree is done, each edge needs to gain a width. I don't have two disjunct types here: portal vs solid. No, everything is soup. So how do I deal with it?
z comparison acts on sectors .. I can use the split horizon to be implement tolerance
so after bsp .. edge may have gaps
	return to axis-alignment errm y sort per room. x order switch on scanline. I only need one cut .. not 3. Compare it with scanline is 8 bit * denominator (32 bit (area spanned by slopes) )
		this is not too bad (compared to checks on 16 scanline on average). And it works for slithers. Ah, basically rounding creates DMZ. When 3 cuts are between 4 pixel rays, we don't care. Creative use of fractions and floats does not give us this.
	So, BSP is back. Tree became natural and organic again.
	Rooms are used to fill this tree in a way to keep heuristic. Portals are as effective inside a tree. It would be a liberating feeling to use 90Â° FoV in 3d and let BSP handle the rest.
	Looks like the BSP tree cuts are the ones which don't need any correction (unlike the my MVP with simple rectangle borders: the 3d clipping). BSP is the correction.
	Is flowing over the bounds of a portal possible? Rectangle checks by ray tracing. I may need to to this on the outside pixels. So for each vertex, check the signs of its edges.
	If I have those outer bounds around in 2d space, I can project them back into 3d. These are tighter than just expanding the edges. So I fight overflow right from the start (for slither portals)?
	Ah, so these pixels are used only ones ( no bean counting here ), but they allow me to keept overflow inside the 1px "guard band".
	Good thing is: This works with scene graphs. No matter how much I like the infinite precision for levels, the z-buffer on Jaguar is just broken. And I hate those Wing Commander I slow downs.

/**
 * My code already calls methods on vectors. So I could probably come up with a small set of operations which will be called (back) from the data flow graph.
 * If I go full precision, I can have flat n-gons ( like Doom ) in a scene graph. Matrix multiplication appears here ( and in a limited way in UV mapping (I should pull the feed-through out of the Matrix))
 * Keep in mind that I don't use full precision for physics or even frame to frame iteration. I stick to a single frame for the MVP. And scene graphs also don't need full precision. Just the nodes need to be consistent so that walls of houses stay flat as do the windshield and hood of a car. Or its plate. IMHO warping on n-gons gives this typical Jaguar (Skyhammer) early PC underdog 3d games () look. Doom ressurection on 32x ?
 * Usually, fixed point ease the calculation. With infinite precsion, the "exception" to add more bits is so expensive that floats makes sense
 * Vectors need to be floated as a whole to be able to use MAC. The rotation matrix is 15 bit so that I don't have a special case with the normalisation of vector lengths. So I can use it right away for other math.
 * It does not matter if it is slightly above the norm because both factors will be approx 1/2 below max abs value. 3d math only adds 3 values max. So 1/4 + tolerance avoids any overflow.
 * float vertices are kinda logical. The clipping introduces the normalized vectors of the beam planes. The exception I identified is when the camera is close to long edge, but both vertices are far away.
 * How does the code throw this : I probably need to look into the code. vertex:slope : slope may throw because small camera movement changes it. This is before any division: just (vertex-camera) x edge
 * so the lower bits of vertex may need to be rotated, too. To preserve flat n-gons, the first vector needs 46 bit precsion. We don't care. Just implementing the throw is expensive (code size, coding). Doing it twice not so much.
 * Horizon is not really more difficult. Screen filling floor is similar.

/* JRISC/42
The remainder register may be read after the divide has completed, this value in this register may either be 
positive, in which case it contains the actual remainder, or negative, in which case it contains the remainder 
minus the divisor. 

Uh this costs some cycles. How do I deal with more bits in the divisor? Pentium says: Do an estimate with low precsion. Then multiply the full precision. Divide the remainder.
I think that we can prove that the remainder only changes the result by a small ammount. Like: We don't have to repeat endlessly. Just once for more precision. Anyways: integrate in the precision pull
*/

/**
 * Going infinite precsion, the guardband and NDCs are off the table. Portals are a first class citizen. Exact cuts are calculated using the exception mechanism. The two step 3dNDC 3dpixel process is replaced by this.
 * I do it because it is fun. I do it because it profits from my short cascade of calculations. I like descent.
 * What about the miner robots in descent? Did I not opt for fast BSP and DMZ? No problem here: cuts are still only calculated with pixel precsion (DMZ), just there is no additional epsilon:
 * Once a cut comes too close to the border of the DMC, the precision ramps up. Same with edge tracers. For textures it is okay to know the start and end pixel.
 * In the atlas I don't accept fences which are not aligned. When I just round down the slope of either x or y, I can be sure that they don't expand beyond an x or y maximum value. Second system: I could add half of the rest to the start?
 */

/*
All the code uses portals and going clock-wise. No abs() tricks or bit-logic on signs. No delta_x or delty_y = 0 speed ups. All projected edges have projected vertices (DMZ)
Corner vertices are gone. XY property of "on the border" is not special anymore. Only thing may be that : vertex slope :  the slope is anchored only on one vertex. The other is only pixel precise.
Horizon still exists: slope+bias .

Ah, it is weird how I still embrace the DMZ for cuts . So: No area between 3 edges calculation ( which would be a shorter data path).
The real killer for using tolerances was that it seems to pull in normalization. I mean, I still like tolerances in general, but for vector graphics they look like a bad fit.
*/
/**
 * Epsilon: I can use only positive factors and then some adds to feed intervals through the calculation, but the idea of an exception is to make the trigger cheap. So I use a worst case of worst case so to say.
 * Still, this is derived from the interval calculation. Multiplication of scalars is precise, just afterwards we round to nearest ( needs an add ) ( not how slope in the blitter is rounded towards zero which needs a branch or SHR 15; ADD)
 * The rounding errors of the factors add up in MAC. A scalar multiplication has 2 * input error + 0.5 final rounding error. Cross product has 2*2*input error. Inner product has 3*2 .
 * Propagation lets the tolerance rise exponentially. Like, after 3 operations we lost half of our bits. Makes no sense to proceed? The good thing: small triangle with short edges have a lower chance of triggering reevalutions.
 * Small triangles without clipping have a short cascade. Yeah, there is the check against the BSP, though.
 * It makes sense to float the results of cross product. Matrix is almost normalized, not much happens. Inner product is scalar. Usually we care only for the sign? But when we use it subtract, then subtract at 32 bit (sign?), and then float.
 * 
 * Is it kinda weird that feeding the tolerance throught the Matrix allows for flat n-gons and glitch free texture? Ah, and portals.
 * Yeah, on sane hardware, portals would only be a minor speed up and would be axis aligned ( see Tomb Raider ). Back projection is cheap due to the low number.
 * I read that the software renderer on Quake uses spans not unlike the column buffer on Doom. No idea how occlusion culling is to work with this, but it can help with the fill rate:
 * Funny thing on the Jaguar is that we could make an axis aligned tree and flip x and y direction. Possibly triggered by geometry. Span buffer is just no my cup of tea.
 * In contrast to scanline rendering, this would support portals. It sucks in b-trees or bucket sort. Ugly.
 */

/**
 Backprojection works like:  use slope ( 2d floated) z=0, vertex  , z= value given by field of view. Cross product => xz xz xy+yx rounding is in out budget if our pixels are not just rounded, but include 1px guard. They do include this on the screen border because we clip tigtly (some smaller epsilon) around the in screen rays.
 I think horizon is already a floated normal. But the bias shift follows from the vertex math. Take the wedge, normalize, multply with grad. I don't need precision. Floating would be good enough. Though fast inverse is very fast after said floating. low precision MUL is fast in JRISC.
 So really, I should not use pixel floor/ceil and epsilon. This will collide with the screen borders. The other way: epsilon and then rounding. I just don't like this kind of code here when infinite precision would not need it. 
 */
/*
For z order I use the cut -> horizon. Then some math on which side of the cut which polygon is in front. So epsilon stuff just like for the projection. Clipping to avoid overflow also.
Z still is just like texture. I don't care about errors. Just, gaps between geometry are so much more ugly than z-fighting
And for the textures I should drop the Atlas. Oh wait: Without GL_REPEAT even transparent pixels may appear. So, for high quality graphics I need to move any result of the perspective projection into bounds. Same for delta*span length (integer division is actually exact here, no rounding happens within the blitter). Same if I ever plan to use the z-buffer for more than validation (problem of the horizon or some minor location shift letting us change sides).
This is really a reason to use screen space affine texture mapping. 15 bit delta for whole screen. Let's limit to small triangles: 12 bit delta -> 24 bit determiand . Ah rounding still does happen!
 */
/*
Beamtree with infinite precision is not really slower.
Looks like the code needs to be duplicated for screenSpace2d and worldSpace3d
For cascade portals in 3d, we need to check if 3 edges eclose an area clockwise  ( 2d rasterizer does not care, but that is far away)
can just as well do this before rotation for a wide dataflow. code stays almost as complex in sequence. screenspace would need rounding also
beam.normal = fromCamera x slope .   rotation=volume.sign = late product(normals) = (beam0 x beam1 = ray) inner normal
so infinite precision would be a graph: vertices -> normals -> edges -> signs . Each vertex has an index. The graph operators let us identify every node
MAC Output is 32 bit which can be stored easily. So rounding happens before.
To add precision, we just shift in the other direction. So at least here, double register shift is not missing for us.
There is still the problem of the sign. Sign affects the significiant bits! It cost lies in the default path. But then again it is just round: shift Addq shift  2 added cycles
So now we have to persist 48 bits. Data becomes bigger than all the linking indices. But for correction, we need the new 32 bits separately.
In the next step we get the the LH+HL and the LL outputs. Both 32 bit. Both better be persisted. But we feed along the LH. So I need a precision per node and one per edge.
Precision grow is the exception. I alread gathered all links from backtracking. I can easily allocate new ( larger ) nodes.
I feel like generic malloc needs a b-tree for the gaps. A fixed granularity could help. Ah, I should clear this buffer per frame. Or: move node from the start into the gap.
So this is still a queue. The wider high precision nodes are filled by two standard nodes. Like in the rare case that I have to increase precision twice.
Precision increase request backtrack. They stop when full precision is present at a node already.
With 24 bit world coordinates, perhaps I can backtrack projected vertices? With NDC there are 3 steps!
Bresenham has these changed signs, but otherwise? Too close to zero, reset the tracer/cursor like you would at a vertex. Use infinite precision here.
Of course, this does not really fit screen2d BSP for quick and dirty occlusion. On screen I can build the BSP roughly front to back, but draw back to front
Jaguar does not have much memory, but far less speed. I can keep this information. Then draw cuts 10% wider than necessary. Would still be ugly with translucency, but Jaguar has none.

vertex inner normal  ' works both ways
all products with three elements, but no bias. JRISC bias is slow anyways
behind camera : inner product with nose
	edge  
	plane

vertex projection is good: edge tracer are limited to 16bit. 16*24
rounding errors everywhere: clipping with epsilon should avoid out of bounds draw. rasterizer just uses while y< and if dx>0

Since I cannot do portals perfectly in any way, I accept that the projection wobble, edge wobble and texture wobble lead to glitches
The edge loop is already quite fat, so detectin of abs()<epsilon would be okay.
	ray trace ( how about the signs? Ah, yeah make sure that in increases along x. Single ray? Difficult) => ray needs to check all edges of triangle
	ray trace would be 16(pixel)x16(rotation) + camera (32) signs with edges (infinite precision). Texture: later
		ray trace also would need the inverse transfomration matrix and I don't want Matrix inverse ( it makes the code hard to read).

Even is this may be slower ( I miss the simple screen border cuts ), I am very interested in the timing results.
Math debugging using self consistency ( the expressions are free of Matrix math where I always confuse rows and cols)

/*
Game objects inside the level need a fast solution. So 2d BSP it is. Cuts are stored as 16:16. As with clipping on borders,
the order of cuts may be wrong when we compare two of them and (of course) use the original edge slope. On the border moving is simple, but still in 2s we could just swap pixels, ah no cascade.
To not grow the glit, a cut which lands outside the sector is just moved on the border. Shortest distance. Does it even matter? Divide by zero?
So this is inhertently glitchy. With 8bit screen resolution and 8 bit to hide rounding, an edge crossing the screen will have on wrong pixel?
But then again this glitch only happens when 3 edges nearly cross at the same position.
It only affects many pixels if these edges are also nearly parallel. NDC makes sure to use the full precision ( up to minimal value to stay compatible with ABS).
Cuts use relative position. So uh, still only 15 bit usable for me. DIV is unsinged, MAC is signed. What a mess. Costs 4 cycles.

With a scene graph, game objects coordinates don't even manifest in world coordinates (Collision boxes or spheres).
So how can I use a portal renderer to clip game objects? What about LoD NURBS? I like racing games. There I draw a lot of road, but solve collsions only at some location (and on the car: Only the wheel patches. bb with other cars bb. But cars are anchored on the road patches at this time. So most of the frames: no car-car collision checks).
Same for height field. I mean, MAC is fast, but there is still no reason to not combine transformations. Like, I don't want a global height field like in Magic Carpet! As a physicist, this is not my style.

Rough front to back ordering. Longest edge first. No BSP merge yet. Should already look okay. Unlike my thoughts about glitches in Tomb Raider,
the sorting here is only for performance. So I it is okay not to merge objects in levels. Just insert the object center z into the level z.
Descent levels are composed of convex polyhedra. So sorting is -- yeah well portal renderer. We sort objects by z and then draw the surrounding polyhedron then go through portals.

Ah scrap that. For meshes and height field it is more important to go over shared edges and vertices to create a compact BSP.
I don't even plan for huge height fields. NURBS with their smoothness may need special code anyways. NURBS have bounding boxes.
Okay, I see how large NURBS and height fields in a racing game me better materialize in a world. Then far way occlusion can indeed be solved using events and floats with epsilon (beware the camera rotation: Only allow this for pseudo2d game. I think on Jaguar we are allowed to provide a limited backview like the rear mirrors in a lot of old games).

				// so now, a slope vector  inner product  gradient vector  is 0 if with its dual, but wedge product if cross. I keep these arround for all edges of polygon and portal ( size of the total state of cuts() )
				// How do we describe a cut? There is this relative vector between the bases. Bias looks ugly
				// a cut is zero on grad is inner prod=> easy . But what is inversion here? How can xy be a result of two inner products ( the multiplication of the inverse matrix)
				// from algebra we know: xy = wedged,transposed &* gradient &* (bias=delta vector )
				// reverse reading
				// decompose delta vector
				let arg = item.map(it => (it[0] as Vertex_OnScreen).position)
				const delta = new Vec2(arg)				// cuts are stored per portal and polygon. For portal-polygon cutting, we have nxm delta. This is similar to how we compare each edge with every corner
				//  into parts orthogonal to each line   => gives us the abstract s,t coords similar to texture mapping
				const parts_carried_by_basis_vector = grad.mul_left_vec(delta)   // not normalized     // return from here if any basis vector starting from VertexOnScreen is negative! How to share code with horizon? What is the equivalent ot the mul only check on the corners? It is the area between 3 cuts. So actually, do we really have to do nxm cuts with rounding? With vertex on screen, we can decide by the sign. Corner is a vertex on screen here ( OOP inheritance). Likewise vertices of the polygon need to be on different sides of the beam-plane.
				const de = grad.nominator[0].innerProduct(slope.nominator[1])  // determinant = denominator to normalize the parts vector. This obviously scales with the length of our basis vectors. The formula for inverse tells us that this is correct. Physics units would be m^2 and compensates both products
				if (de == 0) return null





				// add up the basis vectors    // this only needs a scalar factor per basis vector
				const xy_rel = Matrix.mul__Matrices_of_Rows([[parts_carried_by_basis_vector], slope.nominator])  // adding up vectors brings up back into the xy coordinate system. Matrix of Rows looks weird as static method
				const xy = xy_rel.nominator[0].scalarProduct(1 / de).apply((item[0][0] as Vertex_OnScreen).position)  // I have 3 point types: 3d, 2d, ah and 2d with an interface for the rasterizer: integer_part_of_y_()
				return xy   // if we use (subpixel) correct screen coordinates, at least it is easy to debug the code ( which gives us the order of vertices ). My fear is the lack of bounds for almost parallel edges from polygon and portal. This would still be a problem because I always round. At least these are the real y for Bresenham. I can detect ovefflow as with the screen borders..Error calculation is straight forward and I could just have a multi-edge inner loop (exception) which takes the minimum on every line and stores the result for portal cascade or BSP merging


				// divide by determinand = cross wedgeProduct .. where does this sum come from? Ah, this is just the normalization from the step above
				// PS: Why don't we need per vector normalization here like in gram schmidt?
				//     The wedge product propagates the length of both factors . Gramm Schmidt in 3d is just different. Perhaps it is due to the fact that we acually normalize there. For orthogonalize we would use the cross product only, which would get unstable if basis vectors drift to different lengths. But here, the length mean something and we don't iterate so the glitch would be single frame.

		//So all edges already lost their depth at this point. (bias and cross should be rounded)
		//So even without pre clipping on the rectangle, I use screen coords (vertex culling (each vertex on each pyramid face) makes this work in 3d with vertices having negative z)
		//So really, how do I calculate the area of 3 edges cutting?
		//usually, I do wedge product (two vectors) in 2d and cross,inner with 3 vectors in 3d
		//Algebra? So the cuts are: bias.sum()+ [coefs 2x2] &* [x,y]  solve for  [x,y]
		// => [xy] = swapped &* bias  /  (det==wedge product)
		// So from these points I gather two vectors and calculate cross product finally.
		// for point->vectors and for cross(*-*) I need to subtract, so a common denominator: a*b * b*c * c*a 
		// nominator doubles the muls +1 in cross. Priorr they are bias*swapped*extent^2
		// 9 = 1+ 2 *(4)
		// 9 - 5 = 4   -- uh, if I add units ( like metres ) to xy

		// Instead of getting crazy with DMZ rules, and considering that I need pair-wise cuts rounded to pixel coords,
		// I can calculate the area using pixel coords. If it is small: test each pixel ( raytracing is my base => no problem with rounding )
		// So only slithers are a problem? So not actually take the area? All cuts within a rectangle between all rays is still an interesting case.
