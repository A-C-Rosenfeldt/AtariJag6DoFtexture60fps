// we look forward -- no FoV>180 no matter the shape. So the most independet thing to do is first to check if line going through both vertices passes in front of us
// so the z plane is back because at least one vertex need to have positive z
// any line will be in positive z -> so this is no test . The actual test is at the end of this paragraph and rather expensive
// the portal is already projected. It is 16 bit. The polygon vertices are still 3d (and I want large z) so they are around 24 bit
// The multiplication is still kinda cheap.  16x14 sha 16x14 add  store the sign bit somewhere ( shr to remove other bits; shl packet to make space OR to combine)
// so we know through which faces of the pyramid the edge passes through .. candidates
// My check was to expand the edge and camera into a surface. The pyramid edges (rays) then have an elevation
// The edge passe through fades where the elevation changes. Why do we need candidates? Is it only to discriminate against vertex-border ? Probably was a stupid bug in my old(prior to portals) code
// Now how to I detect lines, whose surface cuts through the pyramid, but not the line itself
// One half of the surface lies in negative z. I can shot a ray along the negative z axis, just deviating minimally ( some normal projection stuff ) 
// Ah this is a double cross product? These feel weird. I converted these equations to cross and then subtract inner product
// camera x edge_slope => normal   . normal x cross slope => shortest direction from camera to edge .  If the z component is negative then cull!
// compensation formulation:    vertex[0].z - slope.z*(vertex[0 | slope ) / (slope^2)    // 24x24 MUL because it is in 3d  . The DIV becomes MUL , of course
// Even though BSP mergers may come. Probably (for low poly) 3d polygon into 2d portal will be the normal case. BSP MVP will add poylgons sequentielly. Multi-Edge rasterizer -> mostly binaray tree. The DMZ thing did not pan out yet, mostly due to slithers: 3 almost parallel lines. The only vailable solution is indeed infinite precision. We have all the coefficients in scratchpad memory. We just need to add the products of the lower bits ( signed with some overlap to postpone carry )

For orthogonalize we would use the cross product only, which would get unstable if basis vectors drift to different lengths. But here, the length mean something and we don't iterate so the glitch would be single frame.
